###### my favourite food id chicken biryani

The aroma of cooking Biryani wafting from the kitchen is enough to make you drool. A melodious union of rice, **spices** and **meat**, this lip smacking dish is rich and packed with calories. Usually cooked in ghee, and sometimes with nuts and raisins thrown in good measure, Biryani is a delicious combination of all things wonderful. **Each region has its own unique method of preparing this lovely dish**. A burst of flavours on your tongue, Biryani is extremely versatile, but always delicious. **Every plate will surprise you**.
